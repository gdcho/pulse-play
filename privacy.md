# Privacy Policy for Pulse Play

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Introduction

Pulse Play ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information when you use Pulse Play.

## Extension Purpose

Pulse Play is a single-purpose Chrome extension designed to provide instant video playback speed control. Our extension allows users to temporarily speed up video content on supported websites using customizable hotkeys and visual indicators.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information from users.** Pulse Play operates entirely locally on your device and does not:

- Collect personally identifiable information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Track your browsing history or web activity
- Monitor your video viewing habits
- Collect authentication information or passwords
- Access your personal communications
- Collect location data
- Monitor user activity (clicks, keystrokes, etc.)
- Access website content beyond what's necessary for video speed control

## Data Usage and Storage

### Local Storage Only

All extension settings and preferences are stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API. This includes:

- Hotkey configurations
- Speed multiplier preferences
- Visual indicator settings
- Platform-specific enable/disable options

### No Data Transmission

- We do not transmit any data to external servers
- We do not share your information with third parties
- We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes
- We do not sell or monetize user data

## Permissions Justification

### activeTab Permission

**Purpose:** To access the currently active tab when the extension popup is opened.
**Usage:** This permission allows us to read the current page's URL to determine if video speed controls should be enabled, and to inject our content script only when needed.

### storage Permission

**Purpose:** To save and retrieve your extension settings and preferences.
**Usage:** This permission enables the extension to remember your hotkey choices, speed settings, and other customizations across browser sessions and devices.

### Host Permissions (https://_/_, http://_/_)

**Purpose:** To detect and control video players on various websites.
**Usage:** These permissions allow the extension to work across different video platforms (YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, etc.) and any website with HTML5 video content. We do not access or collect any data from these websites beyond what's necessary for video speed control.

## Remote Code

**No Remote Code:** Pulse Play does not use any remote code. All JavaScript and functionality is contained within the extension package and runs locally on your device.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or transmit any user data, there are no external data security concerns. Your settings are stored securely using Chrome's built-in storage system, which follows Chrome's security standards.

## Third-Party Services

Pulse Play does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Children's Privacy

Pulse Play does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect any personal information, this extension is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
